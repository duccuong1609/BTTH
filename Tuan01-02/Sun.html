    <p>The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. 
        <br>It is a nearly perfect ball of hot plasma,heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core.
        <br> The Sun radiates this energy mainly as light, ultraviolet, and infrared radiation, and is the most important 
        <br> source of energy for life on Earth.</p>
