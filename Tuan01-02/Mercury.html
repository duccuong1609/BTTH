    <p>Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar System and the closest to the Sun.
        <br> Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 Earth days, the shortest of all the Sun's planets.
        <br> It is named after the Roman god Mercurius (Mercury),
        <br>god of commerce, messenger of the gods, and mediator between gods and mortals, 
        <br>corresponding to the Greek god Hermes (Ἑρμῆς). </p>
